# CollegeTuitionCalculator
A program made long ago when I just started to learn programming. The program asks for input of a student ID and various other factors, and then calculates the college tuition. The valid student ID's are stored in a 2-D array in the file. If you do not enter a correct one, the program will keep asking for a valid response. Might add a exit option later. For now, just use control + c for Windows or command  + c on Mac.
